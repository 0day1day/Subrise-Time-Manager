Subrise Time Manager
====================

v0.0.2
------
Found some time again to work on this project.
* Added login functionality (sql dump in assets/db folder) u:admin p:test
* And made a start with managing the projects

v0.0.1
------
* started with Kohana version 3.1
* threw some standard css and js from the HTML5 boilerplate

_will work further tomorrow going to bed now. It's 3 am and in 4 hours I have to rush to get my train to work._

Summary
-------
My first project in Kohana. Trying to create a time management site where we can track our hours.

Will be looking fairly simple and ugly, but I'll style it when all functionality are in it.

Also hoping to get a bit more familiar using git and github
